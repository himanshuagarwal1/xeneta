you will be required to install following libaries of python

flask
json
requests


Intially I was trying to make it a simple one page application using just javascrpit
but I remembered Flask is also a part of your tech stack so I also used flask.

use following command to run the application after extracting this folder

open cmd and type " cd xeneta-master"
then type "python app.py"

please let me know if you face any issue
